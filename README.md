# Adopt-Me Site

![LandingPage](https://github.com/LennyGonz/Adopt-Me/blob/master/images/Landing-Page.png)

A webapp using the [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs) API to display every single pet up for adoption in all of America. This helps spread awareness about Pets that are in need of a forever home, and hopefully discourge people from buying pets. Puppy mills need to come to an end!! Adoption is the way and I hope to promote that through this website
